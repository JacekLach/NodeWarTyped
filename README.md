NodeWarTyped
============

Typescript type declarations for nodewar (http://nodewar.com/)

=== Usage ===

Assuming you have typescript installed, simply:
    - Reference nodewar.d.ts in your ts files
    - compile them to a single js file (`tsc example-ai.ts`)
    - copy contents of that file to nodewars editor.

Happy hacking!
